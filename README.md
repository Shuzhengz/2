## Overview

 This folder contained all of the homework files for 1678 training 2018 and some other python games.
 Also, this folder contains some of my other codes like Arduino stuff.

 You can use this repo to practice git and pull requests so that you wouldn't be like OMG what do I do when you are trying to create a pull request for the actual robot code
